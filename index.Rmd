Welcome to our website! We hope these resources are useful in your methods careers.

Our intention for this site is to create a repository of R/Stats learning resources, which will include:

- various web self-study courses

- materials created for departmental R camps

- tutorials and problems created by TAs in the context of 200B-D

If you have suggestions for additional topics you want covered, please let us know and we would be happy to organize on your behalf.
